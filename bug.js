In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component that's not directly nested within a route that defines the parameters.  For example, if you have a layout component that wraps multiple routes, and you attempt to use `useParams` within the layout component, it will not work as expected because `useParams` only reads parameters from the currently active route.  This often results in `undefined` values for the parameters or unexpected behavior.  Another issue can be related to nested routes with dynamic segments; a mismatch in the route path definitions could lead to incorrect parameter extraction.
